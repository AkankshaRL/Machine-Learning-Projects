4. **Training & Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Split the data into training and validation sets.  
   - Used techniques like batch normalization and dropout to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess how well the model predicts churn.
