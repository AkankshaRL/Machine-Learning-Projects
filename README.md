## About the Project  
This project involves creating a CNN model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset in computer vision and machine learning. The model achieves high accuracy by leveraging the ability of CNNs to capture spatial features in images.  

---

## Dataset  
- **Source**: [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)  
- **Description**:  
  - 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.  
  - Grayscale images of 28x28 pixels.  
- **Classes**: 10 digits (0-9).  

---

## Model Architecture  
- **Layers**:  
  - Input layer: Flattened 28x28 images.  
  - Convolutional layers: Extract spatial features.  
  - Pooling layers: Reduce dimensionality.  
  - Fully connected layers: Final classification.  
  - Output layer: Softmax activation for 10 classes.  
- **Activation Function**: ReLU for hidden layers, Softmax for output layer.  
- **Optimizer**: Adam.  
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy.
